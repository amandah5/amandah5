# Amanda Healey

M.S. student in Computational Linguistics at Brandeis University  

## About Me
I’m interested in gaining hands-on experience with common natural language processing tools. My linguistics training has drawn me to areas like syntax, semantics, and especially phonology; I hope to learn more about tasks like transcription or speech processing. I'm curious about the ways in which people perceive and produce language, such as by segmenting sounds, interpreting syntactic structure, and disambiguating meaning. In addition, my background in the humanities and performing arts gives me a creative perspective for finding innovative solutions to problems.

**Programming languages:** Python, Java  

## Projects
- **Spanish Language Learning Helper** – Python program providing feedback on Spanish translations. Implements tokenization, lemmatization, and POS tagging.  
- **Song Genre Classifier (IN PROGRESS)** - Python program exploring several multiclass classification models, including Naive Bayes and multinomial logistic regression, to classify a song into one of five possible genres based on features extracted from lyrics.
