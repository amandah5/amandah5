# Hi! My name is Amanda Healey

My linguistics training in theoretical phonology, syntax, and semantics has drawn me to questions about how these areas connect to practical tasks, such as transcription and speech processing. I'm particularly interested in how people perceive and produce language, which ties into lexical, semantic, and structural disambiguation in NLP systems. 
  
In addition, my background in the humanities and performing arts gives me a creative and flexible approach to problem-solving. 
  
I like learning how language works by experimenting with NLP systems. I'm obsessed with clarity and efficiency, and I'm constantly aiming to find the structural patterns that different models uncover.
