# Hi! My name is Amanda Healey

My linguistics training in theoretical phonology, syntax, and semantics has drawn me to questions about how these areas connect to practical tasks, such as transcription and speech processing. I'm particularly interested in how people perceive and produce language, which ties into lexical, semantic, and structural disambiguation in NLP systems. 
  
In addition, my background in the humanities and performing arts gives me a creative and flexible approach to problem-solving. 
  
I like learning how language works by experimenting with NLP systems. I'm obsessed with clarity and efficiency, and I'm constantly aiming to find the structural patterns that different models uncover.

## About Me
* 📔 M.S. student in Computational Linguistics at Brandeis University
* 💻 Programming languages: Python and Java
* 🌐 Natural Languages: English (native), Spanish (intermediate), French (beginner)

## Projects
* **Song Genre Classifier** - Python program exploring several multiclass classification models, including multinomial Naive Bayes and logistic regression, to classify 25,000 songs into one of five possible genres based on features extracted from lyrics. Achieved 66% accuracy with scikit-learn and manual feature engineering.
  * ***New addition*** - Developed a semantic search engine using Sentence-Transformers and FAISS for millisecond-latency, intent-based retrieval of lyrics. Deployed an interactive Streamlit dashboard allowing users to query the dataset via natural language rather than keywords.
* **Spanish Language Learning Helper** – Exploratory Python program that provides feedback on Spanish translations, based on common language-learning errors such as verb tense and agreement. Implements tokenization, lemmatization, and POS tagging.  

## More Fun Facts...

* 💭 INTJ (Myers-Briggs), 5w4 (Enneagram)
* 👀 Grapheme-color synesthesia gives me a vibrant perspective of all the language that I analyze
* 🎵 Music enthusiast ~ I’m highly sensitive to auditory detail, and my immersive response to music shapes the way I think about language
