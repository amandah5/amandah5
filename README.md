# 🔹🤍 Amanda Healey 🤍🔹

  My linguistics training in theoretical phonology, syntax, and semantics has drawn me to questions about how these areas connect to practical tasks, such as transcription and speech processing. I'm particularly interested in how people perceive and produce language, which ties into lexical, semantic, and structural disambiguation in NLP systems. 
  
  In addition, my background in the humanities and performing arts gives me a creative and flexible approach to problem-solving. 
  
  Join me on my journey of coding and debugging one step at a time to learn more about how we all communicate, with my own artistic flair!

## About Me
* 📖 M.S. student in Computational Linguistics at Brandeis University
* 💻 Programming languages: Python and Java, as applied to machine learning tasks

## About Me (the fun stuff)
* 💃 Dancer! I have a dance degree. I approach all my work with a sense of discipline, focus, and rhythm. Ask me about my experience as a professional dancer in a traveling circus (yes, for real)
* 💭 INTJ (Myers-Briggs), 5w4 (Enneagram)
* 👀 Grapheme-color synesthesia gives me an excitingly vibrant view of all the language that I analyze
* 🎵 Music enthusiast. Check out my project where I analyzed song lyrics!
* 🖊️ Currently: probably organizing or checking my planner

## Projects
- **Spanish Language Learning Helper** – Python program providing feedback on Spanish translations. Implements tokenization, lemmatization, and POS tagging.  
- **Song Genre Classifier (IN PROGRESS)** - Python program exploring several multiclass classification models, including multinomial Naive Bayes and logistic regression, to classify a song into one of five possible genres based on features extracted from lyrics.
