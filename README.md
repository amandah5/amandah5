# Amanda Healey

M.S. student in Computational Linguistics at Brandeis University  

## About Me
I am looking to gain hands-on experience with core natural language processing tools. My linguistics training in areas like syntax, semantics, and theoretical phonology has drawn me to questions about how these areas connect to practical tasks, such as transcription and speech processing. I'm particularly interested in how people perceive and produce language, which ties into lexical, semantic, and structural disambiguation in NLP systems. In addition, my background in the humanities and performing arts gives me a creative and flexible approach to problem-solving.

**Programming languages:** Python, Java  

## Projects
- **Spanish Language Learning Helper** – Python program providing feedback on Spanish translations. Implements tokenization, lemmatization, and POS tagging.  
- **Song Genre Classifier (IN PROGRESS)** - Python program exploring several multiclass classification models, including Naive Bayes and multinomial logistic regression, to classify a song into one of five possible genres based on features extracted from lyrics.
